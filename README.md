# 🎮 Building a Web Game with JavaScript

Welcome to my game development project! This repository is where I channel my **passion for video games** into building a game entirely with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** — playable right in the browser.

## 💡 Why This Project?

I've always been passionate about video games — not just playing them, but understanding how they work. This project is my way of combining my love for gaming with my growing skills in **web development**.

By creating this game from scratch, I'm learning how to handle:

- Game loops and animation
- Player input and physics
- Collision detection
- State management
- Asset loading and rendering

## 🕹️ About the Game

- **Type**: one of these (e.g., Platformer / Puzzle / Shooter / Arcade)
- **Platform**: Web browser (Desktop & Mobile friendly)
- **Engine**: Pure JavaScript — no game engines or heavy frameworks
- **Goal**: Deliver a fun, polished experience using only core web tech

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- Canvas API and DOM-based rendering
- Event handling for keyboard/mouse/touch input
- Frame-based animation and game loops
- Managing game states and logic flow
- Designing scalable and reusable game code

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 Canvas or DOM
- CSS3 / Tailwind (optional for styling UI)
- Git for version control
